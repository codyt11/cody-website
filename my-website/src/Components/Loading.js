                <h2>Welcome to my portfolio.</h2> 
                <p>I am a Web Developer with a history in the medical field. 
                Technology and problem solving are my passion!</p>
                <p>I am a born and raised Kansas native. For the last 10 years I have been working in the medical field and going to school for Pharmacy. 
                My passion has always been in tech and i decided that i wasnt happy in the medical field so I attended Lambda School and learned how to code.
                I have a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, JS, NODE.js, React, and Python. The aspect of coding that drives me the most is the difficulty and
                the constant change. Problem solving is what I am best at and what keeps life interesting!
